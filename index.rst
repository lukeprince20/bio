(Taken from *ORCID* Biography):

Luke Prince received the B.S. Degree in electrical and computer engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, in 2014 and the M.S. Degree in electrical and computer engineering, with a concentration in telecommunications, in 2019 from the same university. In 2015-2016, he was an ORISE Post-Bachelor's intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), where he worked on spectral image processing of ultrasonic tomographic imagery, GUI development, and hierarchical data formatting. Since 2017, he has been with Applied Technology, Inc. working as a contractor for the Naval Research Laboratory Tactical Electronic Warfare Division (TEWD), Washington, D.C. supporting Department of Defense contracts on electronic warfare high-fidelity digital modeling and simulation (M&S).
